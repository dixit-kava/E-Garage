The advertisements published on the egarage Platform are independent of the reviews received by such advertisers.

We are a neutral platform and we don't arbitrate disputes, however in case if someone writes a review that the restaurant does not consider to be true, the best option for the restaurant representative would be to contact the reviewer or post a public response in order to clear up any misunderstandings.
